##### JD D'Annunzio

Hello everyone! Welcome to my project for the first term of Code Louisville's Front-End Web Development course.

#### Purpose

This project is intended to replicate the structure and basic features of an existing site found **[here](https://bikeindianapolis.org)**, tweaked for applicability to the Louisville Metro area. I first had the idea when comparing websites for the respective bicycle advocacy groups of Louisville and Indianapolis - I felt Louisville's could use some help.

#### Features

I have implemented the following features:

- A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views

- Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow

- Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page

#### Current Issues

- Fix alignment in header

- Clean up hamburger menu behavior on small screens
